## 🔭 What is this?
Orange Sentry is an embedded honeypot and IDS system based around an Orange Pi Zero 3 2GB. It leverages OSS tools such as Cowrie and Suricata for a robust detection engine and some of my own code to package it all together into a cheap but powerful detection device for people interested insecurity such as researchers, students, hobbyists and practitioners
